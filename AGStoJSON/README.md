This is a Python script that can be run from a workstation to "crawl" an ArcGIS Server instance and produce a JSON file of folders and services.

Search and edit the Python file for the parameters required (e.g. URL, username, password).

The output JSON can be used in the AddLayers.js for the Add Layers widget.
